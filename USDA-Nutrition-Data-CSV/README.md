CSV Nutrition Data from USDA
===

In order to create a shiny app using d3.js and angular.js we will need to gather the data on amino acid profiles.

In particular, we can create a scaler (number of grams of one food) and estimate how much of one's daily nutrition for that nutrient a certain foodstuff will result in.


This assumes of course that the food eaten in combination do not affect the total amount of essential nutrient absorbed (which certainly may not be true all the time).

BUT this spreads awareness -- makes us click the buttons -- and overall helps bring more popular interest in the matter of nutrition.
